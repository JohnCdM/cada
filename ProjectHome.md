CADA (which stands for "Computation of Analytic Derivatives Automatically") is a MATLAB software program for computing analytic derivatives of mathematical functions defined by MATLAB code.  CADA is designed so that the derivative code that is generated can be differentiated as many times as desired to obtain derivatives of any order.  Derivatives at every level are stored sparsely, namely, only the nonzero derivatives are stored along with the indices of these derivatives.
